# MS-DOS_text_editor
My very old code from circa 1994. A small and fast text editor - 76K or 96K depending on whether you build single or multiple file version,
does not take much space on a floppy disk.

This is writtent in Turbo-Pascal (can be downloaded from http://ccm.net/download/download-24152-turbo-pascal) and Assembler
Needs to run on MS-DOS (there are plenty emulators around, I tried this code on DOSBox on my Mac from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/

The application messages and comments in the application are in Russian (sorry for this) in MS-DOS code page.

SPE.PAS it will be a single window version (I used to give it out to whoever wanted it)
SPE_L.PAS - multiple window version (this was designed specially for my wife, who used it at work).
UNITS directory contains those of my Pascal libraries that are needed for this application (Pascal plus a bit of embedded assembler) - 
this is a subset of libraries I have developed and used in many different applications. 
ASM directory contains a bit of stand-along assembler
